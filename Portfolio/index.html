    Fingerprint ATM based System
    </h2>
    <dir class="projectlanguage">
        Language used:
        <br><span>UML</span>
    </dir>
 <p>
    
    A fingerprint-based ATM system is a biometric security technology <br>
     that uses a person's unique fingerprint for authentication and access <br>
      to automated teller machines (ATMs). By scanning and matching the <br>
       fingerprint, it offers a highly secure and convenient means of verifying <br>
        the user's identity, reducing the reliance on traditional PINs or cards. <br>
         This technology enhances ATM security and reduces the risk of unauthorized  <br>access or fraudulent transactions.
